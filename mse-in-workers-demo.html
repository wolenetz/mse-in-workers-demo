    <b>Demo details</b>
    <p>This is a demo of how usage of Media Source Extensions API from a
    dedicated worker context can avoid "buffering jank" when the main window
    context is very busy, even though the media element playing the buffered
    media is still on that main thread.
    <p>This demo presents a side-by-side comparison of two players, one
    fetching and buffering to its media element solely on the main window
    context, and the other player relying on a dynamically created dedicated
    worker to fetch and buffer the same media into a MediaSource owned by that
    worker's context, yet attached to the main window context's media element
    via the otherwise normal MediaSource object URL. This demo communicates
    that URL to the main window context to accomplish the attachment.
    <p>A scenario where the main thread is under heavy contention is achieved
    by frequently busy-waiting on it while both players are fetching, buffering
    and playing. Furthermore, asynchronous appendBuffer operations are
    performed (on each of the main and worker MSE demos) in small chunks to
    enable rapid appearance of "buffering jank" on the player being buffered
    via MSE on the main thread versus a much better experience on the player
    being buffered via MSE on the worker thread, even if the media stream is
    short.
    <p>In practice, main thread (aka Window context) contention can result from
    many sources, though commonly it is from complex and frequent task
    execution demands made by the application on the Window execution context,
    and is made worse when the platform has less execution capacity available.
    The DOM and associated application javascript operate in the Window
    execution context. DedicatedWorkers run in a concurrent execution context
    with respect to the Window execution context. Even with concurrent
    buffering and smoother playback by using MSE on a dedicated worker context,
    observe that the video element for the MSE-in-Worker player can still have
    poor controls response time when the Window context is under high
    contention. This is because that element (and its controls) can only
    execute on the Window context and their event handlers can have high
    scheduling latency.
    <p>To try in Chromium, use 88.0.4300.0 or greater. As of this demo's
    creation circa that Chromium version, the "MSE-in-Workers" feature is
    behind an experimental flag in Chromium. Enable with cmdline option
    "--enable-experimental-web-platform-features" or navigate to
    chrome://flags/#enable-experimental-web-platform-features, enable it,
    relaunch and then reload this demo to see it in action.
    <p>If the main thread MSE buffering playback is too slow (it might take a
    long while to render even the first frame on some machines), reduce the
    amount of contention on the main thread by stopping the demo, selecting a
    smaller busy-wait duration (to handle other main thread tasks more
    frequently) or a larger append-size (to do more real buffering work when
    scheduled), and restarting the demo.
